Two friends were sitting in the school cafeteria when John excitedly brought up the new girl who had just joined their class. He couldn't help but gush about her radiant smile, which seemed to brighten up the entire room. Mike, who had also noticed her, agreed, adding that her eyes were incredibly captivating. They both admired not just her beauty but also the confident and friendly way she carried herself. John encouraged Mike to introduce himself, believing that she seemed approachable and kind. Mike hesitated but eventually decided that a simple, friendly hello wouldn't hurt. With a mix of nervousness and excitement, he planned to strike up a conversation after class the next day, hoping to learn more about the girl who had already made such a strong impression.
